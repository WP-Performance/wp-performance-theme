## Quick Start

In the root of press-wind theme

```

In your ```wp-config.php``` file, add :
```
# for dev
define('WP_ENV', 'development');
# for production

The "assets" code is in file : ```inc > assets.php```


## CSS writing style

You must use ```@apply``` method for create the CSS style
It's better for reusability of your code and the readability.

Example :
```
.site-header {
  @apply flex my-4 lg:my-10 lg:items-center lg:flex-row flex-col;
}
```

**But you can use the method by the class attribute, if you prefer. Be careful to keep maintainable project.**
